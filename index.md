##### DREAM: Distributed Resources for the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) Advanced Management

The Distributed Resources for the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) Advanced Management (DREAM)
will provide a new way to access large data sets across multiple facilities, which will immediately
improve research efforts as well as numerous other data-intensive applications. With its customizable
user interface that communities of scientists can use to interact with each other, DREAM will provide
a host of underlying services that can be adopted in part or as a whole, including services for
publishing, discovering, moving, and analyzing data. The approach is applicable to anyone with large
or small global data used for analytic data processing needs, resource management, security, and client
applications. To illustrate the applicability of this infrastructure in multiple disciplines, the
project will provide a number of use cases in areas including climate science, hydrology, and biology.

This project will engage closely with DOE, NASA, and NOAA science groups working at the leading edge
of computing. These engagements—in domains such as biology, climate, and hydrology—will allow us to
advance disciplinary science goals and inform our development of technologies that can accelerate
discovery across DOE more broadly. In addition, the project will be utilize well established
applications, such as:  the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF: [http://esgf.llnl.gov](http://esgf.llnl.gov)), the
Ultrascale Visualization Climate Data Analysis Tools (UV-CDAT: [http://uvcdat.llnl.gov](http://uvcdat.llnl.gov)), and the
Earth System CoG (CoG: [https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/cog/](https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/cog/)).
